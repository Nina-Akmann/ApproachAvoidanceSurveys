## Welcome to our research website.

### Research interests of the group "Fear, anxiety and stress"

The research of our group "Fear, anxiety and stress" focuses on the neurobiological underpinnings of fear and anxiety related processes. Thereby we use fear conditioning, extinction as well as return of fear manipulations as laboratory models for the acquisition and (behavioural) treatment of anxiety disorders as well as relapse respectively. In addition, we are interested in emotional attention processes as well as the molecular genetic associations with fear and anxiety related processes. Specifically, we are interested in how acute and chronic stress experiences over the lifetime affects behavioural and neural correlates of fear conditioning, extinction as well as attention processes. We use a multidimensional approach including peripheral psychophysiological (skin conductance responses, fear potentiated startle), hormone measurements, Virtual-Reality as well as functional neuroimaging (fMRI) methods.

### What is Virtual reality (VR) ?

Virtual reality (VR) can be characterized by the following: "Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated reality with images (3D) and, in many cases, sound. It is transmitted via large screens, in special rooms (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment, CAVE for short) or via a head-mounted display (video or VR glasses)." [@bendelDefinitionVirtuelleRealitaet2018]. Here, the illusion of participating in a synthetic environment is created instead of merely observing it from the outside (Earnshaw, 1993). Advantages of VR can already be partly inferred from the definition. For example, the high flexibility in adaptation and controllability of the synthetic and interactive intervention, the relatively low level of therapist involvement required, and the general "low cost" and wide availability make VR an interesting and novel therapeutic option outside of experimental laboratories [@freemanVirtualRealityAssessment2017, @rivaVirtualRealityPsychotherapy2005]. One of the most important advantages, which will be discussed in more detail here and to which this study will contribute, is the synthetic environment. It provides the opportunity to incorporate and directly address social influence and pressure, as well as other environmental influences. Situations can be created, whose real circumstance would be immoral or illegal. In addition to the synthetic world and realistic representation, VR goggles can be used to shield external visual stimuli that can be distracting. The representation of the environment and objects within VR is possible in 3D. A 3D representation provides a more realistic presentation of the objects triggering craving and behavioral tendencies. In terms of implicit cognitions associated with AKS, this could offer a therapeutic advantage. From the combination of VR and different testing paradigms, there is also the advantage, compared to the classical variants, that the playful character of these methods can lead to an increased motivation of the subjects [@mostajeranGamifiedAlcoholUse2019]. In psychotherapy, VR has been used primarily in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Among these were promising intervention studies for PTSD [@freemanVirtualRealityAssessment2017, @rivaVirtualRealityPsychotherapy2005].
